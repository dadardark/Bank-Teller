TO COMPILE: 
	Simply type 'make' in the console

TO RUN:
	./cq "filename" "time period customers are added to c_queue" "Withdraw time" "Deposit time" "Information time"

SAMPLE RUN COMMAND:
	./cq c_file.txt 1 2 4 6
NOTES:
	Include the .txt when specifying the filename. 
	The array size is not required as I have used a linkedList implementation, so the sizing is calculated dynamically
